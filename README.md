# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to improve fraud detection for:
- E-commerce transactions
- Bank credit card transactions

The solution applies machine learning, geolocation analysis, and explainable AI (SHAP) to detect fraudulent activities while balancing false positives and false negatives.

## Datasets
- Fraud_Data.csv
- IpAddress_to_Country.csv

  - Examine transaction amount distributions
  - Investigate time-based patterns
  - Explore feature correlations
- Task 2: Model Building & Training
- Task 3: Model Explainability
